The Isserians are a humble people ruled by Prince Günther, a young bachelor known for his extravagant parties, in light of his father's illness. Isserians worship [[The Seven]], the major gods recognized by most of Archia's population. The level of devotion Isserians feel toward each of [[The Seven]] is about equivalent, although it can vary from region to region, and most Isserian cities bear a single temple that is devoted primarily to one particular god. Although they are devoted in their faith, the Isserians' government is controlled entirely by the monarchy, an increasingly unpopular arrangement as news of Günther's lavish parties and incompetent governance continues to spread.

Fortunately their relations with neighboring nations are largely friendly, so they need not fear incursion in face of their weak central government; Isseria trades extensively with Anabe and [[Escher]], and Isserian scholars and nobles often travel to Crescen's respected universities for their studies. Isserian culture emphasizes humility and austerity; Isserians wear simple garb and those who would enrich themselves without first caring for their fellow man are widely looked down on. Still, Isserians are usually friendly to outsiders, even wealthy ones, as long as they are willing to help those in need and perhaps bring a few tales of strange lands to share.

Isserian cities are fairly classic medieval cities, usually with a lord overseeing them (although smaller cities may simply have an elected mayor or a representative of a noble that controls the region). Their architecture reflects the emphasis their culture places on humility and austerity, and their homes are usually small and simple. Even the castles of the nobility often have extensive underground passageways so that they may be large and extravagant without showing off to the outside. Isseria is the breadbasket of Archia; most of its population (about 80%) live in rural areas and work as farmers.
