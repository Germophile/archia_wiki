The world's foremost wizard academy, Crescenscia University's College of Arcane Studies boasts nine departments -- Abjuration, Chronurgy, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, and Transmutation -- each with an Archdean specially appointed by the [[The Magi|Magi]]. Each department has its own campus in the large university city. The school also has a separate College of Scribing to cover other areas of study, such as anthropology and history.

Although the Archdeans don't have explicit, codified political power, they are extremely influential, achieving an almost unrivaled level of celebrity within [[Crescen]]. Their input is often sought by the [[The Magi|Magi]] for difficult decisions.
