Appointed after the Disaster of 1335, Ulathor is a well-respected and somewhat unusual Archdean of Evocation. The school was previously considered the "brute's wizardry," its spells dismissed as simple and barbaric, but Ulathor is a magical theorist of unrivaled expertise, and evocation has become a much more theory-focused school under his tenure.

Ulathor was born and raised in [[Crescen]], although both of his parents were conjuration wizards that had moved there from Isseria to further their studies. He was admitted to Crescenscia at 15 as a student of Conjuration, but eventually switched his concentration to Evocation. When he was a student, [[Romanos Politadis, the Bold Magus|Magus Politadis]], then the Archdean of Evocation, once remarked that Ulathor cast "the most perfect, the most pristine, fireball that \[he'd] ever seen."

> Ulathor is considered at once a brash and collected man. He and Mineas Panoh are old friends -- perhaps more -- and were up-and-coming professors together, often bouncing their students off of each other to refine their studies. Once when his students insisted that breaking through Mineas's shields was impossible, he cast a tiny, expert fire bolt that found its way through a weak spot in Mineas's shield and left a tiny, perfectly linear burn on his lip, a scar which Mineas still wears proudly to this day.

> Unlike his old friend, Ulathor isn't afraid to engage in interdepartmental politics, and is one of the first to make his voice heard when controversial issues are discussed in meetings between the archdeans.
