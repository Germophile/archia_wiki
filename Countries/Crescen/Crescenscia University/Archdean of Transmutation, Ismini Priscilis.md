Ismini's appointment as the archdean of Transmutation was controversial, as their extensive self-transmutation was a little too reminiscent of the mad archdean Zafar, the perpetrator of the Disaster of 1335 that lead to the deaths of over a thousand of Crescenscia's finest students. However, fears were quelled when [[Aftya Shahidi, the Wise Magus|Magus Shahidi]] made a rare public appearance to personally endorse them. Years later, this would widely be regarded as a wise choice that helped prevent [[Crescenscia University]] from falling apart, as Ismini personally restored people's trust in transmutation wizards and helped aid recovery efforts by crafting prosthetic limbs for students who had been injured in the Disaster.

Ismini got their beginnings as a kalashtar from Hrostivik who studied magic in one of [[Spiroch]]'s military academies. However, they chafed against [[Spiroch]]'s normative expectations and a growing unease with the body they were born in. Although they had achieved a high officer position at a remarkably young age, they were deeply unhappy with their place in [[Spiroch]] and used their magic to escape through Jejun and into [[Crescen]], where they eventually learned Common. They were offered a faculty position at Crescenscia without ever actually studying there, and after the Disaster of 1335, they were hand-picked as the new Archdean by [[Aftya Shahidi, the Wise Magus|Magus Shahidi]].

> As a lecturer, Ismini's reputation was rather poor -- a master of transmutation whose understanding of magic was rather alien to the way it was taught at Crescenscia, but they're well-respected as a masterful and efficient department head. They're known for both ruthless efficiency and a fervent dedication to protecting student's and faculty's freedom of expression.

> Though they often sit out of important decisions -- perhaps feeling too culturally removed from Crescen to involve themself in the minutiae of how other departments are run -- they have a strong sense of morality and justice and they never back down if they believe something is wrong.

> They are known for almost never talking about their life prior to leaving Spiroch and clamming up completely if the subject is brought up.
