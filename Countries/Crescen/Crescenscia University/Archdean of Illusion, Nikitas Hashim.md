Nikitas is serving his thirteenth year as [[Crescenscia University]]'s Archdean of Illusion. He reportedly appeared in [[Crescen]] almost out of nowhere ten years prior, drawing a lot of notice as his cloven hooves betrayed him as a fey who'd wandered there from [[Vibria]]. He enrolled as a student, graduated in record time, and returned to his tribe, but a few years later [[Aftya Shahidi, the Wise Magus|Magus Shahidi]] sent word to him that the previous Archdean of Illusion had retired and she wanted him to appear before the [[The Magi|Magi]] as her candidate for their replacement. He travelled all the way from [[Vibria]], sparking national attention as he was considered an extremely unconventional choice, but [[Aftya Shahidi, the Wise Magus|Magus Shahidi]], along with his demonstrated aptitude for illusions, convinced the other Magi that he was the right wizard for the job.

He's made a reputation for himself as an extremely unconventional Archdean, tossing away the class structure employed by other schools of magic for an extremely chaotic approach to learning and advancing that has led to wildly varied times to graduation. Students trying to learn illusion magic under his tenure have regularly had public breakdowns trying to figure out where they might obtain actual magical theory before emerging from his office the next day with a newfound knack for illusion magic and a depth of understanding of magical theory that would seemingly only be possible with years of careful study.

> It is widely speculated that Nikitas is not a wizard at all, but a warlock of the Archfey, or even an archfey himself -- one student claims she once heard a sprite refer to him as the Summer Prince of Roses. Those who have seen it claim his "spellbook" is a poorly bound collection of sketches, song lyrics, and old fables written on an array of different leaves and parchments. Nevertheless, he passed his theory classes with flying colors, demonstrating at least a theoretical mastery of the arcane.

> Speculations are always flying that Nikitas is "up to something", but there are as many theories as to what that might be as there are students to talk about him. Nikitas maintains a generally collegial relationship with other professors, although more observant students have noticed some subtle tension underlying his interactions with Archdean Maneli.
