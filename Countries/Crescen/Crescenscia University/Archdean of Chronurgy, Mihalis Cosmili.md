Chronurgy is a truly remarkable department even among the esteemed schools of [[Crescenscia University]]. Although a small permanent campus is maintained for the department, it rarely has professors or students. Mihalis Cosmili became its archdean when he appeared in its office seven years ago, set up shop, and registered a single class with himself as its professor. It is not known where Mihalis is from, what race he is, or how old he might be, and Mihalis is known for giving extremely cryptic answers when asked.

In his seven-year tenure, the School of Chronurgy has only graduated three students. Before Mihalis appeared, it had been over two hundred years since there was an Archdean of Chronurgy.

> Mihalis is well-respected by students and professors alike. Although the mysteries surrounding his origins lead to frequent challenges to his right to assert himself as archdean, they are generally stemmed by the Magi's continued recognition of his position.   Mihalis is well-known for his quirks, including a complete refusal to acknowledge the existence of certain people, seemingly at random -- this extends to a refusal to even acknowledge mentions of them when they are not present. Star is one of these people, as is one of the three students that graduated from the School of Chronurgy during his tenure.   It is sometimes speculated that Mihalis bears a striking resemblance to descriptions of the previous Archdean of Chronurgy, but these rumors are difficult to corroborate as visual depictions and written descriptions of the man have all been destroyed.
