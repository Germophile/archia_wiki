The newest Archdean at [[Crescenscia University]], Hafthara was appointed only two years ago. Her appointment was controversial for many reasons, including the fact that she was born in [[Jejun]] and the fact that she is the only Archdean whose appointment wasn't unanimous, having been opposed by [[Aftya Shahidi, the Wise Magus|Magus Shahidi]]. Since her appointment, enrollment in the School of Enchantment has swelled, as she is known for not turning down students who apply.

> As a half-yuan-ti whose parents defected from Jejun and brought her to Crescen when she was only seven years old, many question whether she might still carry loyalties to her old country. There is additional stigma carried by her position as the Archdean of Enchantment, which is considered by most to be about on par with Necromancy in terms of ethical dubiousness.
> 
> She has stirred the pot significantly since her appointment, getting into repeated conflict with Archdean Magnesium and Archdean Priscilis. There are rumors she attempted to antagonize Archdean Panoh, Archdean Tassiade, and Archdean Cosmili, but has mostly (or entirely, in the latter case) been ignored. She is rumored to have a friendly or at least neutral relationship with Ursam Ebrahimi, Archdean of Necromancy, however.

> There is significant controversy among students as to whether this conflict is due to Hafthara being a "young up-and-comer stirring up the pot with the classist, conservative old-timers" or whether she has more nefarious motivations. She is significantly less apologetic about the School of Enchantment than her predecessor, which some students admire but others view as a dangerous ethical oversight.
