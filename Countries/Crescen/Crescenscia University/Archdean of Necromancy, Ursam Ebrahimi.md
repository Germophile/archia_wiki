Appointed in 865, Ursam is the longest-serving archdean of Crescenscia University, having held the position for almost 500 years. He is a quiet and measured professor, and does very little to recruit students to his department, personally reviewing all of the applications they received and interviewing eligible candidates before granting them positions in his school. Necromancy is widely known to be the longest course of study offered by Crescenscia, as Ursam gradually introduced several years of ethics classes as prerequisites before students learn any magical theory or practice. Consequently, the department's graduation rate is about 5%, a fact which has led to many unsuccessful challenges to Ursam's tenure over the years.

Once, about 200 years ago, Ursam briefly resigned to enter the Magus tournament after one of the [[The Magi|Magi]] retired, but he was unsuccessful and was immediately accepted back into his position as the Archdean of Necromancy at Crescenscia. He has not made another attempt since.

> Outside of Crescenscia, not much distinction is made between the reputation of Ursam and the reputation of Necromancy itself, and consequently he is widely doubted and feared among the general public. However, among students and professors of Crescenscia, he is regarded with a quiet respect, and generally admired as a reverent and extremely responsible scholar.
> 
> He is often known for discouraging "dark" uses of necromancy such as seeking immortality or attempting true ressurections of the dead, but some students have noted that Ursam is an apparantly human man who never seems to age despite his long tenure, and he is widely believed to have achieved the lichdom he discourages his students from pursuing.
> 
> Ursam and Amare have become good friends over their long tenure together, and are rarely seen to disagree on official university business. He also seems to have a friendly relationship with Mihalis, and the two are often seen quietly catching up between their official duties. He has an apparantly friendly relationship with Hafthara, or at least a significantly less adversarial one than she has with the other deans.
> 
> Ursam is also the adoptive father of Stamatios Ebrahimi, the Dark Magus. However, not much is known about the relationship between them, as both are fairly private individuals who shun the public eye.
