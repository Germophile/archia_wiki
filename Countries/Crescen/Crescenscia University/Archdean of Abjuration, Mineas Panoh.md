[[Crescenscia University]]'s archdean of abjuration, Mineas was appointed to his position after the previous archdean was killed in the Disaster of 1335. Born to wealthy merchants in Danar in 1285, Mineas grew up in Anabe and was sent to Crescenscia for a formal education in magic after he completed his basic schooling when he was 17. Although he returned to Anabe for a few years after his mother's untimely death, he spent most of his life in [[Crescen]] as a student and subsequently as an instructor until he was appointed Archdean of Abjuration.

> Mineas is generally seen as a fairly "normal" archdean -- his education at Crescenscia was extremely standard and he was 50 when he was appointed archdean. Like other archdeans, his mastery of his particular school of magic is unmatched, and he's known for his discerning eye and remarkable situational awareness. Before he became Archdean of Evocation, Professor Magnesium was known to issue a challenge to his students each year: anyone who could land a single spell attack on Mineas would receive an A in his class, regardless of their performance; no student ever succeeded. Â  In terms of Crescian and Crescenscian politics, Mineas is a well-known abstention, remaining neutral in all conflicts between the other deans and never dipping his toes into wider political goings-on. His focus is extremely internal to his department, and he's known to get angry with students who try to suggest the coursework in Abjuration is too difficult compared to the other schools.
