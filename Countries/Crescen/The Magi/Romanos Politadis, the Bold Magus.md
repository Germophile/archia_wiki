Romanos Politadis is the longest-serving Magus of the three, winning his position in 1310 when, already a renowned Archdean of Evocation, he stunned the Crescian public by obliterating his competition entirely, leaving himself as the only remaining candidate for a position among the [[The Magi|Magi]]. He is known for advocating brash, sweeping decisions, earning himself the title of "the Bold Magus."   Romanos is a human man, and elderly, born to two unmarried first-year students at Crescenscia university and raised by the woman who was Archdean of Evocation before him. He has lead a storied career and is well-respected, but as he gets older, most of the public discussion around him revolves around his surely-imminent retirement, a topic which he refuses to acknowledge or discuss.
