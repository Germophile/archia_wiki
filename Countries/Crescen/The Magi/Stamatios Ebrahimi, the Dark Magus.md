Orphaned at the age of 11 and raised by [[Archdean of Necromancy, Ursam Ebrahimi|Ursam Ebrahimi]], Stamatios is the newest of the [[The Magi|Magi]] and the only one who wasn't an Archdean before becoming a Magus. He was the last place qualifier, and was selected by [[Aftya Shahidi, the Wise Magus|Aftya]] and [[Romanos Politadis, the Bold Magus|Romanos]] after lengthy deliberation.

By the public, Stamatios is largely distrusted due to his practice of and prowess with Necromancy, earning himself the title of "the Dark Magus." However, he enjoys a quietly respectful relationship with the Archdeans and is reportedly happy to let the other Magi take the lead in the public eye.
