Born to two regular day laborers in Crescen with no more magical proficiency than a cleaning cantrip, Aftya Shahidi is often considered a "Magus of the People," someone who understands the position of the common folk in Crescen as well as the intricacies of Crescian governance and magical education. She is perhaps the most influential of the [[The Magi|Magi]], appointed after an upset win in the Magus tournament thirty years ago -- although she had previously been an Archdean at [[Crescenscia University]], she was not expected to get very far in the tournament as a Divination wizard. However, she used her knowledge of her opponents to get all the way to the final round, where the previous Magi recognized her wisdom and selected her to join their ranks.

Since then, she has become one of the most beloved Magi in Crescian history, although she rarely leaves the Palatial Citadel. One of the most powerful Diviners to come out of Crescenscia, she is renowned for her fairness and foresight, leading to her title as "The Wise Magus."
