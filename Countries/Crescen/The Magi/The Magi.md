Selected by a magical tournament and appointed by the other Magi, to be a Magus is to be one of the most powerful archmages in Crescen. Almost all Magi were trained in magic at [[Crescenscia University]], and most were Archdeans before they took their place as Magi. The Magi live in the Palatial Citadel, from where they make all decisions of state.

The three current Magi are [[Romanos Politadis, the Bold Magus]], [[Aftya Shahidi, the Wise Magus]], and [[Stamatios Ebrahimi, the Dark Magus]].
