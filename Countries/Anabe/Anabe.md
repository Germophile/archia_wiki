Anabe is Archia's only democratic nation. Each city elects three delegates to go to Hahra, its capital, and collectively make decisions for the nation as a whole; but for the most part, Anabian cities are self-governing by an elected Governor and a city council of ten members. The criteria for political eligibility vary from city to city, but as far as delegates to Hahra go, any delegates sent by an Anabian city will be recognized by the council. The city of Naban, a massive metropolis in the far reaches of Anabe, once became so frustrated with the council's actions that they sent a delegation that consisted of a seagull, an urchin, and a conch shell.

The people of Anabe are often sailors, fishermen, and merchants; 98% of the nation's population lives within 20 miles of its coast, and the land claimed by the nation itself is just a thin sliver of land along a long reach of coastline. The areas of the ocean claimed by Anabe are unusually smooth, clean sailing, believed by many to be a blessing by [[The Seven]], and Fen'rem specifically. Anabian sailors often incorporate sun and moon symbols into their garments; the sun symbol is particularly popular, as it is widely believed that Fen'rem will protect any vessel that bears the symbol of Gavriel, the angel of the sun.

Anabian cities are actually fairly small compared to other nations; the largest city, Chanah, has just under 200,000 people. Because little of the land in Anabe has arable soil, most of its population is urban, and Anabians rely on the sea for 70% of their food (most of the remaining 30% comes from trade with [[Isseria]]). Their architecture is distinctive, as their buildings are made of extravagant white marble and full of pillars, arches, and decorative statues. Because of Anabe's fair climate, outdoor sports and activities are popular, and throngs of customers flow to the nation's many open-air markets.
