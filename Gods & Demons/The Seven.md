The Seven are Archia's major gods, worshiped in Isseria, Anabe, Crescen, and (to a lesser extent) Escher and Vibria. The suffixes -rem, -ani, and -ev are honorifics and it is considered highly irreverent to speak the gods' names without them, but it isn't unusual for them to be omitted in written texts after the first instance.

The Seven traditionally named in the following order:

### [[Ostia'ani]], the First

### [[Kolif'rem]], the Second

### [[Yenid'rem]], the Third

### [[Nairi'rem]], the Fourth

### [[Fen'rem]], the Fifth

### [[Evesk'ani]], the Sixth

### [[Fleur-Ek'ev]], the Seventh
