Josephine is better known as the current Radiant of the [[Church of Kolif'rem]], often referred to as the Radiant or the Scorch. She is a power and fanatical Light cleric in service of Kolif'rem. She is a human woman was famously left at a temple doorstep as a baby and climbed the church ranks quickly, becoming the youngest ever Lightbringer at 16. Her last name, Scorch, was given to her when she was a young teenager because she showed profound aptitude for fire magic. She has been the Radiant for close to 40 years; although she is in her late sixties, she famously still looks like she's in her thirties, leading to rumors that she has been blessed by Kolif'rem with eternal youth.  As the Radiant, Josephine is in charge of overseeing the operations of the Grand Temple, as well as acting as the [[Church of Kolif'rem|Church]]'s representation in [[Escher]]'s government. She is famous for showing up to High Council meetings without the delegation of light clerics that traditionally accompany Radiants to high council meetings.
